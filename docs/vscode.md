# VSCode setup
Currently the main IDE used in the development of the application is VSCode. Using any IDE is of course welcomed. Here I will store the configuration that I am currently using.

You can set this configuration in your `settings.json` file

```json
{
    "eslint.useFlatConfig": true,
    "eslint.rules.customizations": [
        { "rule": "*", "severity": "warn" },
    ]
}
```
